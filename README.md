# Algorithms for Massive Datasets

The PageRank algorithm implementation project was developed as part of the university course "Algorithms For Massive Datasets". The main objective of the project was to implement the PageRank algorithm for analyzing the relevance of products in a customer review dataset.

The PageRank algorithm, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is widely used to evaluate the importance and popularity of web pages within a hyperlinked graph. In the context of this project, the PageRank algorithm was adapted to identify the most influential products based on the connections between products in customer reviews.

The project was implemented using the Python programming language and the Pandas and PySpark libraries for data manipulation and analysis. Two different implementations of the PageRank algorithm were created, each with a different approach for calculating the PageRank scores of the products. Visualizations of the results were also provided using the Matplotlib library.

The project was structured into several phases, including data processing, constructing the product graph, and calculating the PageRank scores. Analysis and comparisons were made between the obtained PageRank scores and other product relevance metrics to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm.

This project represents a practical application of algorithms for massive datasets and was carried out to gain skills in large-scale data analysis. The complete source code and documentation of the project are available on GitHub for reference and contribution by the academic community and interested developers.
